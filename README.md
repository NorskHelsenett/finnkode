# Finnkode

## ðŸš€ Quick start

### Local development
Requires the following:

- Ruby
- Rubygems
- Bundler
- Node
- NPM

#### Install
Run `bundle install` then `npm install`.

#### Develop
Run `gulp watch`

## Files to implement
### CSS, JS, and images
 
Files ready for _test_ implementation in the actual solution can be found here:

https://github.com/ehelse/finnkode/tree/carecom/dist/assets

The CSS is autoprefixed and the SVGs are optimized.  Neither the CSS nor the JS are compressed yet, since both the prototype and actual solution are still under development--these will need to be compressed before release. Both the CSS and JS have maps.

### HTML
Jekyll builds the static prototype based on templates, pages, and includes build with Liquid markup.  The source HTML can be viewed here:
